    <h1> The three equation of motion </h1>

    <big> Equation 1 <br>

        v = u + at <br>

        where, <br>
        v = final velocity <br>
        u = initial velocity <br>
        a = acceleration <br>
        t = time taken <br>

    </big>
    <hr>

    <big> Equation 2 <br>

        s = ut + 1/2 at<sup>2</sup> <br>

        where, <br>
        s = displacement <br>
        u = initial velocity <br>
        a = acceleration <br>
        t = time taken <br>
    </big>
    <hr>

    <big> Equation 3 <br>

        v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as <br>

        where, <br>
        v = final velocity <br>
        u = initial velocity <br>
        a = acceleration <br>
        s = displacement <br>
